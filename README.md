# Kafka Health Check

Health checker for Kafka brokers and clusters that operates by

* inserting a message in a dedicated health check topic and waiting for it to
become available on the consumer side,
* checking whether the broker is in the in-sync replica set for all partitions it replicates,
* checking whether under-repicated partitions exist, and
* checking whether offline partitions exist.

## Status
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/andreas-schroeder/kafka-health-check.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/andreas-schroeder/kafka-health-check)

## Usage

```
kafka-health-check usage:
  -broker-id uint
    	id of the Kafka broker to health check (default 0)
  -broker-port uint
    	Kafka broker port (default 9092)
  -check-interval duration
    	how frequently to perform health checks (default 10s)
  -no-topic-creation
    	disable automatic topic creation and deletion.
  -server-port uint
    	port to open for http health status queries (default 8000)
  -topic string
    	name of the topic to use - use one per broker, defaults to broker-<id>-health-check
  -zookeeper string
    	ZooKeeper connect string (e.g. node1:2181,node2:2181,.../chroot)
```

## Broker Health

Broker health can be queried at `/`:

```
$ curl -s localhost:8000/
sync
```

Return codes and response bodies are:
* `200` with `sync` for a healthy broker that is fully in sync with all leaders.
* `200` with `imok` for a healthy broker that replays messages of its health
                    check topic, but is not fully in sync.
* `500` with `nook` for an unhealthy broker that fails to replay messages in its health
  check topic within [100 milliseconds](./main.go#L42).

## Cluster Health

Cluster health can be queried at `/cluster`:

```
$ curl -s localhost:8000/cluster
green
```

Return codes and response bodies are:
* `200` with `green`  if all replicas of all partitions of all topics are in sync.
* `200` with `yellow` if one or more partitions are under-replicated.
* `500` with `red` if one or more partitions are offline.

## Supported Kafka Versions

Tested with the following Kafka versions:

* 0.10.0.1
* 0.10.0.0
* 0.9.0.1
* 0.9.0.0

Kafka 0.8 is not supported.

see the [compatibility spec](./compatibility/spec.yaml) for the full list of executed compatibility checks.
To execute the compatibility checks, run `make compatibility`. Running the checks require [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

## Building

Run `make` to build after running `make deps` to restore the dependencies using [govendor](https://github.com/kardianos/govendor).

### Prerequisites

* Make to run the [Makefile](Makefile)
* [Go 1.6](https://golang.org/dl/) since it's written in Go


## Notable Details on Health Check Behavior

* When first started, the checker tries to find the Kafka broker to check in the cluster metadata. Then, it tries to
  find the health check topic, and creates it if missing by communicating directly with ZooKeeper(configuration:
  10 seconds message lifetime, one single partition assigned to the broker to check).
  This behavior can be disabled by using `-no-topic-creation`.
* When shutting down, the checker deletes to health check topic partition by communicating directly with ZooKeeper.
  This behavior can be disabled by using `-no-topic-creation`.
* The check will try to create the health check topic only on its first connection after startup. If the topic
  disappears later while the check is running, it will not try to re-create its health check topic.
* If the broker health check fails, the cluster health will be set to `red`.
